[00:00.99]I WILL SHOW YOU
[00:00.98]Yes, I am still amazed that I have you. It's still hard to understand how you chose me. How after just one short conversation you knew I was meant for you. But now I know the truth of your conviction. I've never been with someone who suited me so perfectly. You seduced me with your sexy body and strong spirit, and you've kept me with your tender heart. I know you that I can't have you completely and maybe not even for much longer. But I'm still happy. A part of you has become part of me and that is enough.
[00:00.97]You'll laugh when I say this, but I dream about you every night. Probably because I can't see you often enough. But when I'm awake I know that you are the furthest thing from a dream. Sometimes I imagine that you are built from solid rock: a moving statue and an indestructible human being. You absolutely contain yourself and then again much more than yourself. Your confidence is consuming and your perspective is huge. You have no place in your life for jealousy or complaints. My friends seem so small in comparison, with their problems always spilling over onto everyone else.
[00:00.96]I want you to know how much you've opened my eyes and helped me truly see myself. Until now, my life has been an undecided back-and-forth, and now I know that I've wasted too much time. But now my direction seems clear, and I have confidence in my future. The past doesn't seem to matter anymore. You've made me see possibilities I would never have imagined before.
[00:00.95]Yes, I want to please you. But it's through pleasing you that I'll become a better and stronger person. There is nothing I want more than to transform myself through you. You challenge me to grow beyond myself and leave my weaker self behind. I will show you how beautiful I can be, and I will show you how brilliant I can become. This way, I know I'll always have your love.
[00:00.94]Forever yours,
